          <h2>De Dolfijn</h2>
          <p>De Dolfijn is an elementary school. Because of that it has its very own playground where schoolkids and others in the neighbourhood can play. When school is done a few kids usually linger around!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Hof van Eden</h2>
          <p>The Hof van Eden is a smaller playground within the neighbourhood itself. It is not associated with a school and sometimes the neighbourhood hosts small events for children to enjoy. There is enough to do for children who are alone, but even more if they have friends with them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Volo</h2>
          <p>Volo is the name of a gymnastics association that is rarely used for other sports. As such there is only 1 object to play on and there aren't many kids playing, if any at all.</p>
        </li>
